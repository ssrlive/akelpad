-----------------------------------------------------------
XBrackets plugin for AkelPad text editor
-----------------------------------------------------------

This plugin allows to:
1) autocomplete brackets ([{""}]) i.e. it inserts
   corresponding right bracket when the left bracket
   is typed.
   The plugin uses "smart" autocompletion:
   - next character is analysed for ([{ brackets;
   - next & previous characters are analysed for " quote.
2) highlight active brackets i.e. it highlights a bracket
   under the cursor and its corresponding pair bracket.
3) go to matching pair bracket - using GoToMatchingBracket
   or GoToNearestBracket.
4) select a text between matching pair brackets - using
   SelToMatchingBracket or SelToNearestBrackets.

Note:
To prevent repainting of active brackets highlighted,
XBrackets::Main must be loaded AFTER Coder::HighLight.
Functions "GoToMatchingBracket" and "SelToMatchingBracket",
as well as "GoToNearestBracket" and "SelToNearestBrackets",
require the plugin to be active - i.e. its function "Main"
must be active. If it is not active, these functions
activate it automatically.

External call example:

  var lpBuffer;
  var a;
  var s = "";

  if ( lpBuffer = AkelPad.MemAlloc(64 * _TSIZE) )
  {
    var res;

    res = AkelPad.Call("XBrackets::SelToMatchingBracket", 1, lpBuffer);
    if ( res > 0 )
    {
      s = AkelPad.MemRead(lpBuffer, _TSTR);
    }

    AkelPad.MemFree(lpBuffer);
  }

  a = s.split(" ");
  if ( a.length == 3 )
  {
    WScript.Echo( "pos1 = " + a[0] + "\npos2 = " + a[1] + "\nbrackets = " + a[2] );
  }

Additional options (file "AkelFiles\Plugs\XBrackets.ini"):
  common.user_brpairs = «» ‘’ “”
    User-defined bracket pairs which can be autocompleted and highlighted
    by XBrackets. Note that bracket pairs which have identical opening and
    closing symbols (such as "" or '') can be highlighted incorrectly because
    there is no ability to definitely understand whether the caret is by the
    opening or by the closing symbol of such bracket pair.
    To define your own bracket pairs, follow these rules:
    1) Bracket pairs must be separated by space (' ')
    2) Each bracket pair must consist of 2 characters: the first character
       defines left (opening) bracket symbol and the second character defines
       right (closing) bracket symbol. If you define just 1 character or
       3 or more characters as a bracket pair, this bracket pair will be
       ignored.
    3) You can define up to 30 bracket pairs.
    4) Don't forget to add new closing/opening bracket character to the
       'next_char_ok'/'prev_char_ok' set if needed.

  autobrackets.next_char_ok = .,!?:;<)]}"'>/ »’”
    Set of characters which are OK for brackets autocompletion when
    you type an opening bracket BEFORE such character.
    Additionally, any bracket can be autocompleted before the following
    hard-coded characters: '\r', '\n', '\0', ' ' and '\t'.
    You can define up to 90 characters in this set. Spaces are ignored.

  autobrackets.prev_char_ok = ([{<= «‘“
    Set of characters which are OK for brackets autocompletion when
    you type a bracket AFTER such character. This rule is applied only
    to those bracket pairs which have identical opening and closing
    symbols (such as "" or '').
    Additionally, such bracket can be autocompleted after the following
    hard-coded characters: '\r', '\n', '\0', ' ' and '\t'.
    You can define up to 90 characters in this set. Spaces are ignored.

  autocomplete.all_autobr = 0
    Default behaviour: characters from the 'next_char_ok' set
    (and from the 'prev_char_ok' set depending on the bracket type)
    are checked to permit the brackets autocompletion.
  autocomplete.all_autobr = 1
    Brackets can be autocompleted BEFORE any character (i.e. the
    'next_char_ok' set is ignored). This rule additionally depends
    on the option "Even if corresponding right bracket exists".
  autocomplete.all_autobr = 2
    Brackets can be autocompleted AFTER any character (i.e. the
    'prev_char_ok' set is ignored). This rule is applied only to
    those bracket pairs which have identical opening and closing
    symbols (such as "" or '').
  autocomplete.all_autobr = 3
    Brackets can be autocompleted BEFORE and AFTER any character
    (i.e. both 'next_char_ok' and 'prev_char_ok' sets are ignored).

  autocomplete.ovr_autobr = 0
    In Overwrite mode, right (closing) bracket is not added automatically.
  autocomplete.ovr_autobr = 1
    In Overwrite mode, right (closing) bracket is added as a new character
    (not over the existing character).
  autocomplete.ovr_autobr = 2
    In Overwrite mode, right (closing) bracket appears instead of the
    existing character (i.e. over that character).

  autocomplete.sel_autobr = 0
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is disappeared
    (replaced with the bracket).
  autocomplete.sel_autobr = 1
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair.
  autocomplete.sel_autobr = 2
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair, and the brackets pair become selected
    also. If the selected text already starts and ends with the corresponding
    brackets pair, the brackets will be removed.
  autocomplete.sel_autobr = 3
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair, and the brackets pair is _not_ selected
    also. If the selected text already starts and ends with the corresponding
    brackets pair, the brackets will be removed. If the surrounding brackets
    are not selected, they are not removed. (This mode was inspired by the
    Sublime Text editor.)
  autocomplete.sel_autobr = 4
    When left (opening) bracket is typed, the selected text is enclosed with
    the corresponding brackets pair, and the brackets pair is _not_ selected
    also. If the selected text already starts and ends with the corresponding
    brackets pair, the brackets will be removed. If the surrounding brackets
    are not selected, they are also removed. Thus, type a left bracket/quote
    to enclose the selected text with the corresponding brackets pair, and
    type the left bracket/quote again to remove the enclosing brackets/quotes.
    (This mode was inspired by the Sublime Text editor.)

  highlight.hlt_bothbr = 1
    When the caret is between two pair brackets, both pairs are highlighted.
  highlight.hlt_bothbr = 0
    When the caret is between two pair brackets, just one pair is highlighted
    (highest priority is to the right of a closing bracket).

  highlight.hlt_style = 3
    XBrackets redraws brackets highlighted by Coder.
    Pair brackets are highlighted using bold font.
  highlight.hlt_style = 2
    XBrackets redraws brackets highlighted by Coder.
    Pair brackets are highlighted using default font.
  highlight.hlt_style = 1
    Pair brackets are highlighted using bold font.
    XBrackets does not redraw brackets highlighted by Coder.
  highlight.hlt_style = 0
    Pair brackets are highlighted using default font.
    XBrackets does not redraw brackets highlighted by Coder.

  highlight.hlt_xmode = 7
    This option controls what is used by XBrackets to search and highlight
    pair brackets. It allows to disable calls to AkelEdit about the file
    syntax as well as usage of the internal pair bracket searching algorithm.
    This option is supposed to be used for experimental purposes.
    The value of this option will be the sum of the following numbers which
    are responsible for the plugin behavior:
    1 - use the internal pair bracket/quote searching algorithm;
    2 - use AEM_HLGETHIGHLIGHT (highlight, quotes);
    4 - use AEM_FINDFOLD (folding blocks).

  highlight.quote_detect_lines = 1
    Number of text lines to be processed by XBrackets while searching for
    a pair quote in both directions (when the search direction can not be
    determined, for example:  "  " ).
    If this value exceeds 'highlight.quote_max_lines', then it is decreased
    to the value of 'highlight.quote_max_lines'.
    The value of 1 means "within current line".
    The value of 0 forbids to search for a pair quote under such conditions.

  highlight.quote_max_lines = 10
    Number of text lines to be processed by XBrackets while searching for
    a pair quote in one certain direction (when the search direction can be
    determined, for example:  "a b" ).
    The value of 1 means "within current line".
    The value of 0 forbids to search for a pair quote at all.

  highlight.br_max_lines = 0
    Number of text lines to be processed by XBrackets while searching for
    a pair bracket.
    The value of 0 means "unrestricted" - i.e. to the end of file.

  nearestbr.goto_flags = 0
    This option controls the behavior of the GoToNearestBracket function.
    The value of this option will be the sum of the following numbers:
    0 - (default) the caret goes to the nearest bracket (either left or
        right), staying inside the brackets (either after the left bracket
        or before the right bracket);
    1 - the caret goes to the bracket, staying outside of the brackets
        (either before the left bracket or after the right bracket);
    16 - the caret always goes to the left bracket;
    32 - the caret always goes to the right bracket.
    When the sum of (16 + 32) is used, it is treated as 16.

  nearestbr.selto_flags = 2
    This option controls the behavior of the SelToNearestBrackets function.
    The value of this option will be the sum of the following numbers:
    0 - the surrounding brackets themselves are either included or not
        included in the selection, depending on the position of the caret;
    1 - the surrounding brackets are always included in the selection;
    2 - repeated calls of SelToNearestBrackets widen the nearest brackets
        selection (i.e. the selection within brackets becomes the selection
        outside brackets, and the repeated calls widen the selection to the
        nearest surrounding brackets).

  nearestbr.max_lines = 0
    Number of text lines to be processed by XBrackets while searching for
    the nearest pair of brackets.
    The value of 1 means "within current line".
    The value of 0 means "unrestricted" - i.e. to the end of file.

The plugin allows you to change the additional options without closing AkelPad.
In three steps, in this order:
  1a. Open the "Plugins" window (Settings-> Plugins...) and disable the
function XBrackets::Main (if it is active).
  1b. (alternative) Run XBrackets::Settings and double-click (with the left
mouse button) the caption "Status: the plugin is active". As a result, the
caption will be changed to "Status: the plugin is NOT active".
When you deactivate the plugin it automatically saves its settings.
  2. Open the file "XBrackets.ini" (if the settings are stored in an .ini file)
or a registry key "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Akelsoft\AkelPad\Plugs" and
change the required options of the XBrackets plugin.
Don't forget to save the modified file "XBrackets.ini".
  3. Activate the XBrackets plugin by calling its function XBrackets::Main
or by running its function XBrackets::Settings and double-clicking (with the
left mouse button) the caption "Status: the plugin is NOT active".
When you activate the plugin it automatically re-reads its settings.
